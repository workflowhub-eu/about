<summary>COVID-19 BioHackathon (2020-04-05 / 2020-04-11)</summary>

Workflow Hub is one of the [topics](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20/wiki/Workflow-Hub) at the [Virtual COVID-19 BioHackathon](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20/):

> This topic proposes to set up an early pre-production instance of the Workflow Hub, covid19.workflowhub.eu, to be a registry that gather the COVID-19 workflows and their metadata. Part of the tasks here is also to curate the existing workflows and help making them interoperable, reusable and reproducible.

> The curated metadata will be in a FAIR format based on RO-Crate and BioSchemas annotations and maintained separate from the Workflow Hub; where possible contributed back to the workflow's origin GitHub repositories.

Anyone is welcome to join!
