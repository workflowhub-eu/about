WorkflowHub will help make your workflows findable and citable, and this guide will help you get started with that process.


{% include callout.html type="tip" content="if you want to test WorkflowHub and its features, 
there is a [development instance available here](https://dev.workflowhub.eu/)." %}

## 1. Register yourself on WorkflowHub

Register yourself on the [sign up page](https://workflowhub.eu/signup) of WorkflowHub if you do not have an account. You can also log in using your [LS Login](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) credentials.


## 2. Decide which `space` you would like to create a `team` in

**Figure 1** below highlights the basic structure of WorkflowHub, and examples of the three types of `spaces` where you could create a `team`.

You can create a `team` in any or all of the following `spaces`:

- [**Independent teams**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/3): this is where you can create a team if you do not require a specific space
- [**A pre-existing space**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes), for example:
     * [**Australian BioCommons**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/8)
     * [**BioExcel**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/2)
     * [**EOSC-Life**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/6)
- [**A new space**](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/new): if a pre-existing space is not suitable, you can create a space
     * This is a good option if you represent a group, consortium, or community where multiple teams might want to register with WorkflowHub


{% include image.html file="spaces.svg" caption="Fig 1. Left - the relationship between the structural elements of WorkflowHub: spaces, teams and workflows. Right - examples of where you can create your new team on WorkflowHub." alt="Spaces and teams explained" %}

Learn more about teams and spaces on our dedicated [What is a team page](/docs/what-is-a-team/).

{% include callout.html type="note" content="you can create multiple teams in multiple spaces, depending on your requirements." %}



## 3. Create a team or join an existing team

Go to the [create](https://workflowhub.eu/projects/guided_create) and [join](https://workflowhub.eu/projects/guided_join) a team page from WorkflowHub to do so.

More information on how to join a team can be found on the [how to create and join teams and spaces](/docs/joining-a-team/)
{% include callout.html type="important" content="if you are creating a team, make sure the team name is descriptive." %}


**Figure 2** shows the minimum information required for a new team, which includes:

- **Space** - the space you selected or created in step 2 above
- **Team name**
- **Team organization** - the organization that should be linked to your team on WorkflowHub. e.g. [University of Melbourne]()
     * If your organization is not yet on WorkflowHub, you can [create an organization](https://workflowhub.eu/institutions/new)

{% include callout.html type="important" content="you can add multiple organizations to both your profile and teams on WorkflowHub." %}


{% include image.html file="team.svg" caption="Fig 2. Screenshot of required minimum information (numbered) that needs to be entered into the Create a New Team wizard on WorkflowHub." alt="minimum information" %}


## 4. Register workflow(s) 

Workflows can be registered using the [WorkflowHub wizard](https://workflowhub.eu/workflows/new)

There is an extensive guide to the [workflow registration process](/docs/registering-a-workflow/) 
available in the WorkflowHub documentation.
