title: Supported workflow types 
---

It is possible to upload workflows of any type (e.g. bash scripts), either by labelling these workflows as `Other` during registration, or by [proposing a new type](https://workflowhub.eu/workflow_classes/new).

The following workflow types are tested to work well with WorkflowHub:

* Galaxy (`.ga`)
* Common Workflow Language (`.cwl`)
* Nextflow (`.nf`)
* SnakeMake (`.snake`)
* KNIME (`.knwf`)

{% include callout.html type="note" content="Note that it is only possible to automatically generate a diagram for CWL workflows." %}
