## What is a Team?

### Definition
A `Team` represents a group of one or more people collaborating together on a particular activity.

### Description 
The Team provides the ability to describe and promote the activity, and also give credit back to the team. As well as providing credit, a team also has useful abilities such as default Sharing permissions and licence, and the ability to easily set sharing permissions across all members. 

The Team needs to have a Title, and optionally can also have a:
- Description, 
- Public website, and 
- Avatar graphic

{% include callout.html type="important" content="Users need to be a member of a team before they can register items, which will then be related to that Team. A user can be in many Teams, without limit." %}


#### Administrator 
Each Team will have its own administrator - usually the user that initially requested the Team. 

The administrator can:
- Add and remove members, 
- Set member roles,
- Define additional administrators, and
- Define new Organizations, Profiles (to describe members that have not yet registered) and Organisms


## What is a Space?

### Definition
`Spaces` are an umbrella that contains one or more `Teams`. They are a self-administered area, that describes a broad activity (usually related to a funded grant), such as a consortium, or a long-running activity that will need additional `Teams`.

### Description 
The Space must have a title, and can optionally also have a:
- Description, 
- Funding details, 
- Website, and 
- Avatar graphic

Once approved, The Space will have its own administrator who is free to immediately create additional Teams without requiring additional approval.

{% include callout.html type="important" content="For users that just require a single Team, and don’t require a Space, they can choose to just have a site managed Space. They will then just administer their Team without needing to worry about Spaces. Their Team can be moved to their own Space in the future if necessary." %}


## What is an Organization?

### Definition
Your Organization is your affiliation within the context of the Team. It can be an academic institution, company, department, club etc.

### Description
An Organization only requires a Title, but can also include optional location information about the city and country. 

You will be asked to choose or define a new Organization when [joining or creating a Team](/docs/join_create_teams_spaces). 

{% include callout.html type="note" content="You can be linked to multiple different Organizations for multiple different Teams." %}
